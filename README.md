# code-quiz

This challenge is for the fourth week of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge was to utilize the skills we learned to enhance our Javascript such as DOM traversal, localstorage usage, and web APIs. This is a game that is timed for answering basic Javascript questions. Each incorrect answer will deduct 10 seconds from the timer which ultimately becomes the final "score." At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter a name so that they can be saved into the local storage onto the high score board. Clicking on the "View high score" board is always available at the top as well.
